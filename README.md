## Ian Benedict Murillo's Portfolio 
    Hello everyone! This is my personal portfolio website built using simple HTML. It includes my skills, all the projects that I made, and my contact to reach me out.

## How to Run the Project Locally 
To run the website locally using VSCode Live Server, follow these steps:

### Steps to Clone a Repository and Launch a Website in VS Code
1. **Clone the Repository:**
   - Use the Command Palette (Ctrl+Shift+P) and select the `Git: Clone` option, or click the Clone Repository button in the Source Control view.
   - If cloning from GitHub, you will need to authenticate, then choose a repository from the provided list to clone.
   - For other Git providers, enter the repository URL, click `Clone`, and select a local folder where the files will be saved. VS Code will automatically open the folder after cloning.

2. **Open in VS Code:**
   - Launch Visual Studio Code (VSCode).
   - Navigate to `File -> Open Folder` and choose the folder where the repository was cloned.

3. **Install Live Server Extension:**
   - In VS Code, click on the Extensions tab on the left sidebar.
   - Search for "Live Server" and proceed to install it.

4. **Run the Site:**
   - Open the `index.html` file in VS Code.
   - Right-click the file and choose `Open with Live Server`.
   - The website should automatically launch in your default browser at `http://127.0.0.1:5500/`. 

These steps will guide you through setting up and running your web project effortlessly!

*This portfolio uses these basic HTML tags for structuring the website:*

This portfolio utilizes basic HTML tags to create a simple and organized website structure. Headings like `<h1>`, `<h2>`, `<h3>`, `<h4>`, and `<h6>` are used for titles and subtitles, while the `<p>` tag is designated for paragraphs. The `<table>` tag organizes information clearly, with `<tr>` and `<td>` tags for rows and cells, respectively. Images are incorporated using the `<img>` tag, and the `<a>` tag creates clickable links to projects on GitHub and social media. The `<form>`, `<input>`, and `<textarea>` tags enable users to send messages via the contact form. The `<footer>` tag contains details at the bottom of the page, such as copyright information and links to my social media accounts. Other tags like `<hr>`, `<br>`, and `align` help format content by adding spaces, bold text, line breaks, and text alignment. The body background attribute sets the page's background image, while attributes for width and height control the dimensions of images and table cells.
